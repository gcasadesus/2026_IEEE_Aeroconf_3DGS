    Navigation and mapping on the lunar surface require robust perception under challenging conditions, including low texture, harsh lighting, and limited sensor resources. We explore how fine-tunnoing image segmentation methods trained on Earth environments perform in lunar conditions and their impact on mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).
