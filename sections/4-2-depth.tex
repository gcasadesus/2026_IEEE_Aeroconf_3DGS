\subsection{Depth Estimation}
This section evaluates the depth estimation models on the LuSNAR dataset, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics. \Cref{fig:depth_errors} provides a visual comparison of model outputs, while \Cref{tab:depth_models} lists the numerical results.

Traditional stereo methods, such as Block Matching (BM) and Semi-Global Matching (SGBM), produce sparse depth estimates, struggling in regions with challenging illumination or low texture, as shown qualitatively in \Cref{fig:depth_errors}. The quantitative results in \Cref{tab:depth_models} reflect this; while their Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is low, this is a consequence of providing depth only in high-confidence areas, as indicated by their low $\delta_{25\%}$.

In contrast, learning-based stereo models like RAFT-Stereo and CREStereo demonstrate superior performance, generating dense depth maps with high completion rates and accuracy (\Cref{fig:depth_errors}). While their MAE is higher than traditional methods due to denser predictions at long ranges, their low Absolute Relative Error (AbsRel) and significantly higher $\delta_{25\%}$ in \Cref{tab:depth_models} confirm better overall geometric coverage. Although CREStereo achieves slightly higher accuracy, its processing speed is substantially lower, as reported in \Cref{tab:depth_models}. Consequently, we select RAFT-Stereo for our mapping pipeline as it provides the best trade-off between strong accuracy and a frame rate more suitable for real-time operation.

Monocular depth estimation models underperform across all metrics in \Cref{tab:depth_models}, even after being scaled with sparse feature matches. Their performance is likely constrained by the domain shift from the terrestrial datasets they were trained on. Despite their lower accuracy, they remain a potentially valuable source of geometric information when stereo data is unavailable.
