\section{Conclusion}
Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining semantic segmentation with geometric reconstruction for improved hazard detection in planetary navigation. Through extensive experimentation, we found that U-Net++ and LinkNet models achieve superior performance on lunar datasets, enabling accurate terrain classification crucial for surface exploration. The integration with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) not only improves reconstruction accuracy but also enables real-time SLAM and hazard detection capabilities. While our current results show promising improvements in rock detection accuracy, future work should focus on several key areas: incorporating semantic and depth uncertainty estimates to improve reliability, addressing map deformation after pose updates, developing path planning algorithms specifically designed for semantic 3DGS maps, and creating high-fidelity closed-loop simulations for comprehensive system validation. Additionally, evaluating additional test cases and exploring different depth detection models would help validate the generalizability of our findings across diverse terrain types and conditions.
